# Academic/Discipline Intervention Report
This is my semester 4 Website Application Development where i developed the Academic/Discipline Intervention Report. 
It is a web-based system that serves multiple purposes for lecturers in college. The system includes various URLs, such as login, sign-up, dashboard, create intervention report, update and delete
existing intervention report, severity list to refer as guidelines, and search student intervention cases. One of the primary purposes of this system is to allow lecturers to 
input and manage academic and disciplinary intervention reports. Lecturers can use the system to monitor student progress and assess any potential issues with their academic performance or discipline behavior. This way, lecturers can address
concerns proactively and provide timely feedback and support to students.
